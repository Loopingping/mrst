								<li>Number Game Betting Rules and Regulations
								<ul class="trmslong">
								<li><span>Basic concept</span>
								<ul class="trmslong">
								<li><span class="outer">This game is played by betting on the numbers of the balls drawn from a bingo machine.</span></li>
								<li><span class="outer">The Company will provide real time odds on the random draw of balls. You may place your bets based on such odds, in a variety of bet types as explained below.</span></li>
								</ul>
								</li>
								<li><span>Bet Types</span>
								<ul class="trmslong">
								<li><span class="outer">Generally, two types of betting will be available for the Number Game.</span>
								<ul class="trmslong">
								<li><span class="outer2">Pre-Games - Players may place bets before the game starts, but once the game starts no bets will allowed.</span></li>
								 <li><span class="outer2">Running games - Players may place bets after the game starts and different odds will be given for every single ball drawn.</span></li>
								</ul>
								</li>
								</ul>
								</li>
								<li><span>Bet Types</span>
								<ul class="trmslong">
								<li><span class="outer">The pregame bet types are as follows:<br>
								a. Over/Under, First ball drawn or last ball drawn<br>
								b. Odd/Even, First ball or last ball drawn<br>
								c. Odd/Even (FT) (sum of three balls drawn)<br>
								d. Warrior, comparing Second ball drawn or Third ball drawn
								<br><br>
								The "last ball drawn" is defined as the last of a pre-arranged number of bingo balls drawn. If for any reason the last ball is not drawn, all bets on the last ball will be considered void and all the bets on the last ball will be refunded.
								<br><br>
								Payouts are made only on complete games. A complete game is a game where the last ball is drawn without encountering any errors up to that point. In case errors are encountered, the Company reserves the right to void the game and refund the bets.<br>
								</span></li>
								<li><span class="outer">Over/Under, First ball drawn or last ball drawn
								<br><br>
								The Company will offer odds on the number of 1st ball or last ball drawn being "over" or "under."<br>
								Over 1st/last– Ball number 38 to 75 is considered an Over ball.<br>
								Under 1st/last– Ball number 1 to 37 is considered an Under ball.
								<br><br>
								Example: Ball number 30 was drawn as the last ball during the game therefore 'Under' bet wins.<br>
								</span></li>
								<li><span class="outer">Odd/Even, First ball or last ball drawn
								<br><br>
								The Company will offer odds on the number of 1st ball or last ball drawn being "odd" or "even."<br>
								Odd – Odd numbered bingo ball is considered as the Odd ball.<br>
								Even – Even numbered bingo ball is considered as the Even ball.
								<br><br>
								Example: Ball number 30 was drawn as the first ball during the game therefore 'Even' bet wins.<br>
								</span></li>
								<li><span class="outer">Odd/Even FT (sum of three balls drawn)
								<br><br>
								The Company will offer odds on the sum of three balls drawn being an odd or even number.<br>
								Odd (FT) – The sum of three balls drawn is an odd number.<br>
								Even (FT) – The sum of three balls drawn is an even number.
								<br><br>
								Example: The balls numbered 07, 13 and 20 are drawn, and the sum of the numbers of these balls is 40. 40 is an even number, therefore the "Even (FT)" bet wins.<br>
								</span></li>
								<li><span class="outer">Warrior, comparing Second ball drawn or Third ball drawn</span>
								<ul class="trmslong">
								<li><span class="outer2">This game will require three balls to be drawn. This game starts by drawing the 1st ball and is played by comparing the 2nd ball drawn and the 3rd ball drawn, whereby the ball drawn with highest number considered win.</span></li>
								<li><span class="outer2">Number 1 will be the lowest number and number 75 will be the highest number.</span></li>
								<li><span class="outer2">The Company will offer odds for this bet type before the 1st ball is drawn. The player may place bets at any time but before the 1st ball drawn.
								<br><br>
								Example: If the 2nd ball drawn is number 45 and 3rd ball drawn is number 60, then the player that bets on 3rd ball will win the game.<br>
